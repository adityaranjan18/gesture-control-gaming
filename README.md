## 🧠 About the Project

This project lets you control games like **Temple Run** or **Subway Surfers** using simple **hand gestures** instead of a keyboard.

It uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, **OpenCV** for webcam input, and **PyAutoGUI** to simulate keypresses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – real-time video processing
- **MediaPipe** – hand landmark/palm detection
- **PyAutoGUI** – keyboard emulation
- **NumPy**

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Detects full palm using your webcam
- Tracks hand position and movement
- Maps gestures (like hand up/down/side) to keyboard inputs
- Sends key events to control games
